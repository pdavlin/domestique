# Agent Instructions

This document contains everything an AI agent needs to know to work on this repository.

## Project Overview

Domestique is a TypeScript MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that integrates with fitness platforms:
- **Intervals.icu** - Training data, workouts, fitness metrics (CTL/ATL/TSB)
- **TrainerRoad** - Planned workouts via iCal feed

## Development Environment

### Commands Run in Docker

This project uses Docker Compose for development. When possible, run commands in Docker, and not directly on the host machine, like so:

```bash
docker compose exec domestique <command>
```

Examples:
```bash
# Type checking
docker compose exec domestique npm run typecheck

# Run dev server (already running via docker compose up)
docker compose up

# View logs
docker compose logs domestique -f

# Restart after code changes (hot reload is enabled, but sometimes needed)
docker compose restart domestique
```

If any commands need to be run directly on the host machine, run `nvm use` first to ensure you're using the correct version of Node, defined in @.nvmrc.

### Starting Development

```bash
# Start all services
docker compose up

# Or in background
docker compose up -d
```

The development server runs on `http://localhost:3000` with hot reload enabled.

### Docker Services

| Service | Port | Description |
|---------|------|-------------|
| `domestique` | 3000 | Main MCP server (dev mode with hot reload) |
| `domestique-prod` | 3001 | Production-like build (use `--profile prod`) |

### Claude Code on the Web

When using Claude Code on the Web, Docker is not available in the cloud environment. Commands should be run directly using Node.js:

```bash
# Install dependencies (done automatically via SessionStart hook)
npm install

# Run tests
npm test

# Type checking
npm run typecheck

# Build
npm run build
```

## MCP Transport

The server uses Streamable HTTP Transport:

- Single endpoint: `/mcp`
- Authentication: `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header or `?token=<token>` query param
- Session management via `mcp-session-id` header
- Session termination via `DELETE /mcp` endpoint

## Environment Variables

Required in `.env`:
```bash
MCP_AUTH_TOKEN=          # Secret token for MCP authentication
INTERVALS_API_KEY=       # Intervals.icu API key
INTERVALS_ATHLETE_ID=    # Intervals.icu athlete ID
```

Optional:
```bash
# TrainerRoad
TRAINERROAD_CALENDAR_URL=  # Private iCal feed URL
```

## Testing

Tests are in the `tests/` directory mirroring `src/` structure.

```bash
# Tests must run with the test Docker target or locally (not in dev container)
# The dev container doesn't mount the tests/ directory

# Run tests locally
nvm use && npm test

# Or build and run test container
docker build --target test -t domestique-test .
docker run domestique-test
```

**Note:** The dev container only mounts `src/` and `tsconfig.json` for hot reload. Tests directory is not mounted.

## Common Tasks

### Adding a New Tool

1. Add tool implementation in appropriate file (`tools/current.ts`, `tools/historical.ts`, or `tools/planning.ts`)
2. Register in `tools/index.ts` in the `registerTools()` method
3. Add any new API methods to the relevant client (`clients/*.ts`)
4. Ensure the new tool, any new API methods to the existing clients, and/or new clients have extensive test coverage.
5. Ensure the tool description and field descriptions are accurate.
6. Ensure the new tool is represented in the @README.md file.

### Adding a New API Client

1. Create client in `src/clients/`
2. Add configuration in `src/auth/middleware.ts` `getConfig()`
3. Add to `ToolRegistry` constructor in `src/tools/index.ts`
4. Update environment validation if required

### Debugging

```bash
# View container logs
docker compose logs domestique -f

# Check health
curl http://localhost:3000/health

# Test auth
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/mcp \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{}'
```

## Code Style

- Use TypeScript strict mode
- Async/await over promises
- Descriptive error messages with context
- JSDoc comments for public APIs
- No default exports (use named exports)

## Important Notes

1. **Hot reload** - The dev container uses `tsx watch` for hot reload of `src/` files.
2. **express.json() middleware** - Used for Streamable HTTP transport to parse JSON request bodies.
3. **Tool registry is shared** - Created once at server start, but each MCP session gets its own `McpServer` instance.
4. When making changes, ensure that @README.md is up to date.
5. When adding new tools or modifying existing ones, ensure that the tool descriptions and the field descriptions are up to date.
6. Always ensure tests pass with `nvm use && npm test` and always add tests for new functionality.

## MCP Client Compatibility Notes

When implementing MCP features, be aware of these compatibility differences between Claude and ChatGPT:

1. **Tool responses**: ChatGPT uses `structuredContent` for JSON data and expects `content` for narration (e.g., "Here's your daily summary:"). Claude only uses `content`. For compatibility, `structuredContent` should have the tool response as JSON and `content` should have the stringified version of the same JSON.

2. **MCP resources**: ChatGPT does not support resources; Claude does but it can't seem to reliably access resources while calling tools. If any future resources are implemented, you must also implement tools that return the resource content directly (like `get_run_workout_syntax` or `get_cycling_workout_syntax`) as a fallback mechanism for compatibility.

3. **Elicitations**: Neither ChatGPT nor Claude support MCP elicitations, so they can't be used to get user input or show confirmation dialogs. Don't implement or suggest implementing elicitations in the future.

4. Before implementing any MCP features besides tools, such as elicitations, sampling, and prompts, check the latest documentation for both Claude and ChatGPT to ensure compatibility: https://modelcontextprotocol.io/clients.md
